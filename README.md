# Handy Wave Game 🎮🖐️  

An interactive browser-based game that uses real-time hand gestures for gameplay, developed as part of the **Tech Saksham Internship** program. This innovative project combines **computer vision**, **gesture recognition**, and **Python programming** to enhance human-computer interaction.

---

## Features 🌟  
- **Hand Gesture Controls**: Play the game using hand gestures detected in real-time.  
- **Interactive Gameplay**: Engaging and user-friendly game mechanics.  
- **Seamless Integration**: Real-time tracking using advanced computer vision libraries.  
- **Accessibility and Innovation**: Redefines gaming by eliminating traditional input devices.  

---

## Tech Stack 🛠️  
- **Programming Language**: Python  
- **Libraries Used**:  
  - [MediaPipe](https://google.github.io/mediapipe/) for hand tracking and gesture detection  
  - [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/) for real-time video processing  
  - [PyAutoGUI](https://pyautogui.readthedocs.io/) for simulating keyboard actions  
- **Development Tools**: Visual Studio Code  

---

## How It Works 🔍  
1. **Hand Tracking**:  
   - Utilizes **MediaPipe** to detect and track hand landmarks from the webcam feed.  

2. **Gesture Recognition**:  
   - Predefined gestures (e.g., wave, point) are identified for corresponding game actions.  

3. **Game Control**:  
   - Simulates keyboard presses using **PyAutoGUI** to control game mechanics.  

4. **Real-Time Updates**:  
   - Processes webcam input and updates the game dynamically for smooth interaction.
